Must haves (ish)
o Tank collisions: Edge case where enemy tank gets stuck inside brick, usually
  after having bumped up against a player. (All other collisions should be fixed by now.)
o Explosion when eagle killed. Maybe go to main menu instead of freezing simulation
o Overhaul things when changing levels
o Clean up unnecessary comments (of course we can leave the ones that explain
  what our code does, but let's make sure there's no "//HD: Jesus Christ. Alright.
  This boolean is my 56th attempt attempt to fix tank collision...")

Nice to have:
o Instructions (most basic form: HTML hardcoded on blank part of page;
  more advanced form: separate part of main menu; final form: pictures and icons
  pulled from spriteManager, fancy-like.)
o Main menu
o Score tally
