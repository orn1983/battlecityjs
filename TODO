Must haves (ish)
o Tank collisions: Edge case where enemy tank gets stuck inside brick, usually
  after having bumped up against a player. (All other collisions should be fixed by now.)
o Clean up unnecessary comments (of course we can leave the ones that explain
  what our code does, but let's make sure there's no "//HD: Jesus Christ. Alright.
  This boolean is my 56th attempt attempt to fix tank collision...")

o Fix shielded tanks
  + Change color depending on shield left

Nice to have:
o Score tally
