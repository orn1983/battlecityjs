Must haves (ish)
o Tank collisions (getting stuck together)
  XXX - Ignore tank collisions if tank spawns within a collision until there no longer is a
    collision (woah nilly)
  - Make sure fast tanks don't collide
o Explosion when eagle killed. Maybe go to main menu instead of freezing simulation
o Disable keypresses on next map while spawning is taking place
o Overhaul things when changing levels

Nice to have:
o Main menu
o Score tally
