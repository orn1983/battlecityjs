Must haves (ish)
o Powerup size
o Powerup effects
  - Remove all enemy tank scores when picking up grenade (I think -- in the score tally
    at the end of the level, the grenade score is never tallied. Maybe they just use
    the scores as if the tanks were killed?
o Ignore hits when invulnerable
o Tank collisions (getting stuck together)
  XXX - Ignore tank collisions if tank spawns within a collision until there no longer is a
    collision (woah nilly)
  - Make sure fast tanks don't collide
o Delay respawn time after killed. Set invulnerable
o Explosion when eagle killed. Maybe go to main menu instead of freezing simulation
o Delay entering next level

Nice to have:
o Main menu
o Score tally
