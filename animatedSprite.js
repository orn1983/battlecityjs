// OA: TODO I feel that the tanks should store their own sprites. Maybe they should
// also determine how rapidly to change between sprite animations.
// They definitely need to be controlling WHEN to change them.
// HD: NB: I agree. Devil's advocate: We *could* still let animatedSprite manage
// all of it, if we change drawCentredAt so that it uses "orientation" not as a
// call to ctx.rotate(), but as a way of choosing which sprite sprite it's going
// to draw. But if we do that, we're creating unnecessary code for all the
// sprites that don't have different orientations (powerups, for example).
// So I agree with Ã–rn that each entity should store its own sprites and pick
// which one to display, based on that entity's own internal properties
//("Which way am I oriented", "How damaged am I", "Should I be changing size", etc.)
